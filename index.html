            <p><sup>1</sup> Out of network ATM withdrawal fees may apply. See here for details.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> SpotMe<sup>®</sup> on Credit is an optional, no interest / no fee overdraft line of credit
                tied to the
                Secured Deposit Account available to qualifying members with an active Chime Credit Builder Account.
                SpotMe on Debit is an optional, no fee overdraft service attached to the Chime Checking Account
                available to qualifying members after Visa debit card activation. Both SpotMe on Credit and SpotMe on
                Debit are sometimes collectively referred to as "SpotMe" or, if you have signed up to use SpotMe with
                only one account, "SpotMe" means the elected service. To qualify for SpotMe, you must receive $200 or
                more in qualifying direct deposits to your Chime Checking Account each month.</p><br>
            <p>Qualifying members will be allowed to overdraw their Chime Checking Account and/or Secured Deposit
                Account (associated with your Chime Credit Builder credit card) up to $20, but may be later eligible for
                a higher limit of up to $200 or more based on Chime account history, direct deposit frequency and
                amount, spending activity and other risk-based factors. The SpotMe limit will be displayed within the
                Chime mobile app and is subject to change at any time, at Chime’s sole discretion. Although Chime does
                not charge any overdraft fees for SpotMe, there may be out-of-network or third-party fees associated
                with ATM transactions. SpotMe Debit <a href="#" class="ap">Terms and Conditions </a>and SpotMe on Credit

            <p><sup>3</sup> Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the submission of the payment
                file from the payer. We generally make these funds available on the day the payment file is received,
                which may be up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any
                Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Based on a representative study conducted by Experian<sup>®</sup>, members who made their
                first
                purchase with Credit Builder between June 2020 and October 2020 observed an average FICO<sup>®</sup>
                Score 8
                increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact
                on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> To apply for Credit Builder, you must have received a single qualifying direct deposit of
                $200 or more to your Chime Checking Account. The qualifying direct deposit must be from your employer,
                payroll provider, gig economy payer, or benefits payer by Automated Clearing House (ACH) deposit OR
                Original Credit Transaction (OCT). Bank ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, verification or trial

            <p><sup>3</sup> Early access to direct deposit funds depends on the timing of the submission of the payment
                file from the payer. We generally make these funds available on the day the payment file is received,
                which may be up to 2 days earlier than the scheduled payment date.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees may apply except at MoneyPass ATMs in a 7-Eleven, or any
                Allpoint or Visa Plus Alliance ATM.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Based on a representative study conducted by Experian<sup>®</sup>, members who made their
                first
                purchase with Credit Builder between June 2020 and October 2020 observed an average FICO<sup>®</sup>
                Score 8
                increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months. On-time payment history can have a positive impact
                on your credit score. Late payment may negatively impact your credit score</p>
